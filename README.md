# ECRAG Research
## Overview
This repository houses the final PDF of my MSc Thesis titled “ECRAG: Enhanced Corrective Retrieval Augmented Generation with Sub-Document Embedding and Efficient Knowledge Detection.”
ECRAG is designed to improve retrieval accuracy and minimise hallucinations in language model outputs by combining hierarchical sub-document embeddings and dynamic knowledge detection mechanisms.

## Abstract
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems often produce remarkable results but suffer from limitations in accuracy and scalabillity, particularly with large or unstructured datasets. My work extends these concepts and the subsequent Corrective Retrieval Augmented Generation (CRAG) idea by segmenting documents into smaller, semantically coherent subchunks. Additionally, we incorporate a Knowledge Detection Mechanism (KDM) to classify queries as internal or external, thereby improving retrieval precision. Evaluations on a corpus of 250 AI research papers demonstrate up to 99% retrieval accuracy with significantly reduced hallucination rates (about 5%).

## Contents
ECRAG-Thesis.pdf: The final thesis document containing all sections and references.
/code (optional): If you decide to upload supporting code or pseudocode snippets here.
README.md: This file, which summarises the project and usage instructions.

## Usage
### Researchers: 
You can refer to the PDF for the complete methodology, equations, and evaluation metrics used to assess ECRAG’s performance.
### Developers: 
If you’re building retrieval-augmented generative systems, adapt the chunking and subchunking code from the ECRAG Notebook to suit your own context.
